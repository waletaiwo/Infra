# Infra

Deploy an AWS infrastructure with Terraform and manage resources with Ansible



## Description 
For this project, the plan is to utilize Terraform for provisioning the necessary AWS infrastructure, while Ansible will be utilized to manage the resources. Terraform will be utilized to both create and configure th infrastructure resources such as VPC, EC2 instances, RDS databases, and load balancers. Once the infrastructure is set up, Ansible will then be used to maage the configuration of the resources. This approach provides an efficient and reliable way to manage the infrastructure as code, version control and avoid human errors. The combination of Terraform and Ansible will create a powerful infrastructure automation pipeline, leading to more effective management of the infrastructure.
